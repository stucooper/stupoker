$150 buyin, $15,000 guarantee
Starttime: 1:00pm 1300h

Buyin: $150
Finished: 24/103

75k start stack, seated first level. On the trains.
Early splasharound and stack down to 60k pretty quickly.

KEY EARLY HAND:
me: AA enemy 22;
Preflop raise to 3,000 in position enemy calls
Flop: 972 check, I bet 5,000 he calls
Turn: 9. Check/Check. I'm now behind a nine.
River: 8. Enemy bets 16k, I call and lose

Comment: I'm always losing chips with Aces against a set, could I have
lost less? How about a 10k bet on the turn and then a check behind on
the river? I lost 3+5+16 = 24k here, I could have lost 3+5+10 = 18k
instead.

300/600 60.3k stack
56.6k 54 holding whiffs. <963|Q|8> 75 makes second nut straight (JT
nut) and flat calls Q8 who rivered two pair. Pity a 2 or a 7 didn't
come on the turn.

400/800 56.5k
AT gets 532|4 65k now
comment: nice minirush. Maybe a bit of overplay preflop but it worked.

65k
53.8k. AT < KQ. <AT3|6|J> Just flatted a very suss tiny 2k bet on the
river, shown KQ for Broadway nuts. KQs he might've had a flush chance
on the turn as well I can't quite remember.

500/1000 level 56k

QQ luckset v KK (had to call 23k preflop. Check/call double up on flop
and turn)

104.6k 06:00
97s v AK pre.. should I have called a 22k all in?

99.1k BREAK

Break comment: out of the early funk with a QQ luckset! AA < 22 but QQ
> KK so it's 1-all with the set gods. In general there were a lot of
sets seen in this tournament.

Other players: JJ flop QQ8. JJ got checkraised on the turn and called
river. Lost quite a lot on the hand. "Don't fall in love with your
hand".

600/1200
Td8d 7d5d4|2| big raise on turn inpos while I'm drawing but he laid it
down (probably AK).

146k JJ > AJ won a bit over 30k
185k 86 wins heaps after 754|2|8. Check/raise river; expecting a split
but the bettor was just repping a 6 and quickly folded.

220.9k 1000/2000
Annoying hand: Raise to 9k with 99, two callers.
T44 flop, a guy bets and I fold, lady calls.
9 on turn!
Lady ends up winning with JJ > 66.
The 66 bet on T44 probably makes sense, 66 looks good on that orphan
flop and I'm losing to a T as well as a 4.

BAD HAND: Nutshot rivered straight loses to a diamond flush grrr flush
was in diamonds as well same as the big hand from Concord Club
20250723. River betting: 10k, raised to 25k, call. Lucky he didn't
raise more!!

new deck called for, unusual but there was a scuffed card.
