Finished: 70th/110

Comments: I had my notepad with me so I'll copy the raw notes from
that and draw some conclusions at the end. I tried the Killer Poker
No-Limit Tags Table approach (Vohaus KPNL pp 31). In self-dealt pub
tournaments I'm often at an 8-seater round table and that was the case
here. With no obvious "I'm in Seat 6" marker I just call myself Seat 1
and orient the other players around me

Canada Bay is a super nice club and had a superb outside (smoking)
balcony which was great to sit in during the breaks.

Notes:
100k ss. Joined at 200/400 level. No BB Antes. Rego closes @1600h
300/600 98k@1303
(pocket 44) 993 flop craise 4k to 12k; bettor folds. Nice 44 play
(probably a best hand bluff but there's a million turn cards I don't like)
T8 light raise 1.5 to 4k to 6.5k (Leigh accident) me fold reraise 20k!
Leigh open folds AdQd (good discipline by him; he has to be behind)

400/800@1335h
108.9k snall 2k raise cbet 65 turn 2 pair AJ56 raise turn wins the pot
117k AdKd 2.1 pre, 4k flop
J7 T98 miracle flop, craise 2k to 10k 2 callers. I bet 50k on a safe
turn into a 33k pot but everyone folds.
130.8k @ 1416h
134.4k inpos steal multiway on A55A turnboard
2k/4k stack 132.4k
146.4k some nice steals
174.4k 8c7c3,A put in a big craise and won the pot. I guess the bettor
was scared I'd just hit Aces maybe he had 66 or something and it was
time to give up
HINI (Hand I'm not in) KK v AJ AKJ flop.

185.4k BREAK @ 1457h

Notebook comment: Best I've played in ages. Haven't had any all-ins
and been able to 100k -> 185k in 6 levels. In most of my pots I've
been the bettor/raiser, not the checker/caller. Hardly had to showdown
a hand; showing the value of aggressive play. I did overbet J7 on the
T98x turnboard; maybe 25k into the 33k pot makes more sense because
this is Holdem and my changes of being outdrawn were slim.

1.5k/3k 165k down a bit.
ACTION ITEM: Fold the next unsuited one-gapper below QT preflop.
Moved GRRRR

(I then play extremely badly at the new table and don't take the time
to assess who the players are. Getting moved in tournaments can really
suck but they it happens. All your work for the last 90 minutes
assessing your previous table goes out the window).

Action item done, 64 folded UTG. JT3 flop I whiffed it. Donked back
down to 108.5k. Bad BB defence against SB who raised pre with A8 and
was ahead all the way on an AK5 flop against my K7

2k/4k 12k pre 8h6h flop KK3. Avoid speculative hands shorthanded to a
raise.

101k start back to the start stack of 100k. "Back to basics, Andy"

3k/6k The aipf shover has been very active with his all-in preflop
shoves. I call his 78k all in with TT, he sheepishly shows
A9. Naturally he gets an Ace on the river to stay alive with his
shockingly bad play.

Soon after I take my chance small blind Q7 with my last 24k and get
looked up by J7 who flops a Jack and stays ahead. Ouch!

$150 SATELLITE: Early double up with JhTh on 9h8c3s flop. Later on I
bust out with AT on Th9c3h against QhJh who has the absolute joint and
hits an Ah turn for the instant flush. I did manage to make a great
preflop fold of AhKh when the betting went 2k, me 10k, third guy all
in 26k, first guy undercall all-in 24k. I took my time but made the
fold. 26k had AA, 24k undercaller had KK and I had no chance!! AA hold
up and would've held up against my AhKh as well. Super fold and I did
very well listening to the betting in a three-way pot.
