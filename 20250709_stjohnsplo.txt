St Johns Park Bowling Club
$400 buyin PLO (2 re-entries) $20,000 guarantee

Buyin: $400
Finished: 11/70

Comments: This was a tournament I was super-excited about and had been
looking forward to playing as soon as I heard about it. It was on the
same night as State of Origin 3 the Sydney game so I hoped there might
have been some overlay but in the end the guarantee was comfortably
met. I'm pleased to report that I didn't need any re-entires (I turned
up with $1,200 cash just in case) and on the whole I played pretty
well. I had a long WhatsApp discussion with Russell during the game so
I'll copy that discussion word for word into this report. What with
time differences between Sydney and Las Vegas Russell wasn't around
for the first few hours of the discussion but his advice once he comes
online at 2200 10pm is valuable.

2200 24 left
2201 R Nice. bbs? relative stack size?
2202 Me 146k now three tables 8,8,8
2202 Blinds 1.5/3+3k
2209 R Ok close it! No blow ups
2211 Photo showing stack of 270k
2231 Back to 107k
2231 R you lost 200k?
2235 Yeah couple of pots I had 50k in and didn't win
(one of these was an unnecessary blind v blind 6k pot to 18k 30k flop
call)
2237 Tables 6,6,5
2248 68k need a double soon but staying patient and folding pre
2249 R What are the blinds? 3/6?
2249 Yeah 3/6+6. If I'm in for 15 or more pre I'm basically committed.
2250 R why weren't you patient when you had 300k
2250 R Chasing draws?
2250 I overplayed AKQx a few times
2250 Got oesd plus set against top set
(actually it was gutshot 4458 on Q64 against QQxy)
2250 Stuff like that
2252 R oesd is garbage in plo. 8 outs. If board doesn't pair
2253 160k
2254 R let's go
2254 There's a break in 90 seconds
2254 protect it
2255 The mega chip leader from earlier is all in for 35k now
(it was AAQJ against KKxy on KT8. Ten on the turn saw mega chip leader out)
2256 9 mins of break left. 13 left I think.
2259 Voice call me if you can
2259 (voice call. Position is super important in PLO. Protect your stack)
2309 136k after blinds through
2309 R don't overvalue naked kings
2310 R also be aware of playing AA face up
2310 R if you can get it all in pre with AA of course do it
2314 KK just good to me. Jxy K turn JJ doubles me. 336k
2314 R how did you see turn? small bet on flop?
2315 flop got checked through, JJ was angling for craise
2316 I decent bet turn he went ballistic with his losing set. I think he
     was dead I had KKJ
2316 R protect the stack now!
     defensive posture, small stabs
     position first
     first goal to make the money
2321 Yep. There's a megapot on 652 on a raised pot I folded JT22 on. Good
     preflop fold by me.
2325 R no danglers. All four cards must work together. JT22 is trash
     don't try to make small sets.
2327 6+6 now, two tables
2327 Double suited hands if reasonably connected can open for a raise
2327 Photo of 332k stack
2332 Photo of my bustout hand
QsJdTd9h all on vs KhQdTh8d. Board KsTc8c,6c,Kc
2333 R Oh no. I hope that wasn't you
S Busto. Pot raise big blind KT8 flop. Brick then K. Sadly it was me
R What happened on flop?
S I check raised him then he reraises me all in
R without clubs I checkcall there
S No repeaters 7 to A are winners for me. Yeah probably couldve check-called
R you could have just folded turn. you don't have anything yet!
S Yeah true. You either look stupid or a genius. in this one I'm stupid
R You had too many chips (to make this move)
S He had KQT8 ds so his preflop call makes sense
R plug in the equities. you probably had a solid 40%. But you maximised the
  variance playing it that way.
2339 S True. Anyhow time to drive home and it's a long drive.

Screenshot of the above sent to Russ
S Preflop 35%. Flop 51% Turn 40% River 0%
R yeah so flipping on the flop. when you're so close to the money. for piles..
S Yes like you said too high variance for a tourney
R There must have been a lot of shorter stacks. You had 350k. How many to money
  etc (is the most important consideration here)
S We were 1/6 the field 70 to 11 from a 50k start stack so no (my 350k stack
  wasn't that huge once field is 1/6 the average stack is 6x = 300k I'm 350k)
R Problem for me was the clubs. lots of turn cards are kill
  cards. also you're oop. looks nice draw though. He might've folded
  two pair but not three pair.
S Yes he flopped three. The fact I was well behind pre means that I
  forfeit victim rights. KQT8 ds v QJT9 ss but dead in that suit.

Extra comments on hands not mentioned in the chat while I remember
them.

* I cracked a guy's Aces by making two-pair for my tournament life when
I had about 40k left at 3/6+6.
* I had a ton of strategy books but no notepad. The chat with Russ
made for a pretty good notepad (and is reproduced above) but I felt
naked without my notepad and I really should always bring my notepad
it's a key piece of my poker kit).
* I busted a few people at my table as the tournament numbers went
from 20 to 12 players; sometimes with lucky rivering of trips.
AAT9 v 9864 on T82 flop; runout T826T. There was another one where a
mystery river pair gave me the trips and the win.
* I then missed a strong looking draw 6543 on K73 and AKQJ holds when
the runout comes high/high. Only a 9 out inside wrap draw I guess but
it still sucks when they miss.
* This leads to a super-important tournament consideration: YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE THE BUSTOUT SHERIFF. Sit back and let players bust out to
other players (when you youself aren't strong). It happens at the
other tables and it can happen at your table as well. Attrition will
happen in the poker tournament; you don't have to be involved in too
many of the all-in bustout matchups. Protect your stack, as Russell
says.
