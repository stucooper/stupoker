Normally my Wednesday night dealer dealt game is Wenty Leagues Club
but tonight I went to a geographically closer game at the Concord
Club. I was pretty late for the game and joined at the 400/800+800
level.

Notes from my notebook
30k ss 400/800
39,400 8:00
great fold KQ to UTG raise from (unshown) AK.
What is KQ beating? Setting myself up for some bad flop situations.

K9 position raise 3.5k pre T86|5 whiff

500/1000
60,500 at break.
(some levels unshown and probably uninteresting)
140k! KcTc T9c6c me top pair flush draw. Two 87 flopped straights and
a JT top pair poor kicker. Jc on river gives me a pile of chips and
knocks out three players
132,000
99,000 97 shottake fail (against an all-in player of prob 28k)
90k. Nice preflop play. I have KQ and raise a player's 4k to 9k, but a
third player repops to 22k. The 4k opener and I both fold, 22k shows
AA. "Raise to find out where you're at" works preflop.

4 Good player
5 Tightish lady 4th
6 Me
7 Shows his cards a lot
8 9th. Made 2 pair against flopped straight
9 Old Nut Peddlar

1.5/3k. 8 players remaining. 107.5k

86 hits gutty on turn after Jd9d5d flop but AdTd had flopped nut
flush. This was a cooler but I played the river dreadfully and doubled
the flopped flush up.
me: check him: 20k
me: raise to 70k him: all in 97k
me: call

JUST CALL THE 20k on the river next time. river was an Ace so I was
hoping the AdTd (who had raised preflop) had AA but that was wishing
up a hand I could beat, not seeing the situation as it really was.

I am now crippled back to 17.5k

2k/4k 17.5k
6th player busts I'm in the money.

5 left 41k

FINAL HAND: Lost race 33 < A7. It happens.

1) DON'T PAY OFF FLOPPED FLUSHES WITH STRAIGHTS
2) DON'T MAKE A BET THAT ONLY A BETTER HAND WILL CALL

Russell: "What are you getting called by that you beat?"

I was giddy with excitement for gutshotting the straight; not properly
considering what the enemy really has. As a final bad part of the
crippling hand, the guy with the flopped flush was the guy who always
shows his cards so I didn't need to call to see his cards for certain,
he would've shown them to me!!

TAHITM: There's another hand in two minutes
TATSNW: There's another Series Next Week
